    "### Improve Momentum Trading strategies using Hurst (with solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll implementing a strategy to trade on momentum. You'll be using the training wheels version of Auquan's toolbox to abstract out the details since the full version of toolbox is a bit comprehensive to get started with. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're providing you with a bare-bones version that shows you how to use 30 day momentum to trade on Apple, sometime between 2015 and 2017. This naive strategy loses money and that's to be expected. Your goal is to make use of Hurst exponent that you learnt in previous lessons to create a better strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an analytical method of momentum trading, but it is also to turn this into a machine learning problem. This is discussed at the end of the notebook, with a link to an extension exercise on the quant-quest website from Auquan for you to attempt this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals**:\n",
    "1. Understand how the barebones momentum version is working and make yourself comfortable with it\n",
    "2. Use the Hurst exponent to create a money making strategy"

    "It's time for those training wheels to come off. By now you've gotten yourself acquainted with using a small part of Auquan's toolbox for implementing a momentum trading strategy. But there's so much more it can do. For example, you can replace Hurst exponent with an arbitrarily complex machine learning model that makes forward looking predictions and use those predictions to trade. You can also specify any non conventional trading logic depending on your strategy. \n",
